Codes for Elegant Mind Club experiments in VR headsets. Written in Unity and C#. 

Show LED balls at random eccentricities (now 0°, ±30°, ±45°) with random colors. User press "V", "B", or "N" to start the experiment, and press same keys when they
distinguish the color of the LED popping up somewhere. Data will be saved to a generated file "TimeLog.txt", with information of colors and positions of LEDs, the Start 
Time when LED appears, and the User's Reaction Time. (all in GMT milliseconds)
